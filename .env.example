# Copy this file to .env and fill in your values
# NEVER commit your .env file to git!

# ============================================================================
# DEPLOYMENT VARIABLES
# ============================================================================

# REQUIRED: Your deployer wallet private key (with 0x prefix)
# This wallet will become the owner of the deployed contract
# Ensure it has at least 0.1 ETH for deployment gas costs
PRIVATE_KEY=0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

# REQUIRED: Ethereum mainnet RPC URL
# Get a free API key from Alchemy or Infura
# Examples:
#   - Alchemy: https://eth-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/v2/YOUR_API_KEY
#   - Infura: https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/YOUR_PROJECT_ID
#   - Public: https://ethereum-rpc.publicnode.com (rate limited)
ETH_RPC_URL=https://eth-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/v2/YOUR_API_KEY

# OPTIONAL: Etherscan API key for automatic contract verification
# Get your free API key at: https://etherscan.io/myapikey
# If not provided, you'll need to verify the contract manually
ETHERSCAN_API_KEY=YOUR_ETHERSCAN_API_KEY

# ============================================================================
# TESTING VARIABLES
# ============================================================================

# OPTIONAL: RPC URL for fork testing
# Can be the same as ETH_RPC_URL or a different endpoint
# Only needed for running fork tests locally (./test_fork.sh)
# ETH_RPC_URL=https://eth-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/v2/YOUR_API_KEY

# ============================================================================
# NOTES
# ============================================================================

# Security Best Practices:
# 1. Use a dedicated deployer wallet (not your main wallet)
# 2. Fund it with only the ETH needed for deployment (~0.1 ETH)
# 3. Never share your private key or commit it to version control
# 4. After deployment, consider transferring ownership to a multisig wallet
# 5. Keep your API keys secure and rotate them periodically

# Recommended RPC Providers:
# - Alchemy: https://www.alchemy.com/ (fast, reliable, generous free tier)
# - Infura: https://www.infura.io/ (established, reliable)
# - QuickNode: https://www.quicknode.com/ (fast, multiple endpoints)
# - Public RPCs: Free but rate limited, not recommended for production

# Gas Price Estimation:
# At 30 gwei gas price:
# - Contract deployment: ~0.045 ETH
# - Configure 14 tokens: ~0.024 ETH
# - Total estimated: ~0.07 ETH
# Add 50% buffer for safety: ~0.1 ETH recommended

# Testnet Deployment (Optional):
# For testing before mainnet, you can deploy to Sepolia testnet:
# - Get Sepolia ETH from faucet: https://sepoliafaucet.com/
# - Use Sepolia RPC: https://eth-sepolia.g.alchemy.com/v2/YOUR_API_KEY
# - Change chain ID checks in Deploy.s.sol if testing on testnet
